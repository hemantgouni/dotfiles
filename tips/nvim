A few tips:

1. c_Ctrl-R " is the keybind to paste text from register "

2. FileType: buffer-local ONLY (filetype is set once per buffer)
   BufEnter: each time cursor enters a buffer

3. vim.fn.<vimscript_function> invokes that vimscript function

4. V starts linewise insert, C-v starts block insert

5. :%norm can be used to execute a normal mode command on a range (every line here)

6. :helpgrep and :cdo can be used to perform edits on lines matching a pattern

7. q in a :Man buffer closes it

8. :tabm moves tabs
